This focused 2-day workshop brings together leading practitioners in the field to discuss recent progress and promising directions in fermionic neural quantum states, covering applications in electronic structure, hadronic physics, and related areas.
Workshop Details When: December 1-2, 2025 Where: Collège de France, Paris (11 Place Marcelin Berthelot, 75005 Paris) Format: ~12 invited talks + poster session + round-table discussions Participants: ~50 expected attendees</description></item><item><title>UnitaryHack: Win bounties with NetKet</title><link>/posts/3-unitaryhack/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 10:23:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/3-unitaryhack/</guid><description>NetKet is participating in the 2022 edition of UnitaryHack, kindly sponsored by the quantum non-profit Unitary Fund.
The hackathon will run for two weeks, from Friday, June 3 to Friday, June 17. During the hackathon, several high-profile quantum software projects are each proposing several tasks for which Unitary Fund will provide a bounty to the participant completing the task.
NetKet is participating with 4 bounties to this hackathon, which are worth US$ 300 in total.</description></item><item><title>NetKet-friendly Summer School in Toulouse</title><link>/posts/02-toulouse/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 10:23:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/02-toulouse/</guid><description>We are glad to advertise that our dear colleagues in Toulouse are organising a Summer school in April on Machine Learning techniques for Quantum Many-Body Physics. The school will feature several lectures and tutorials on NetKet.
Below you can find the original announcement.
Announcement Toulouse School on Machine Learning for Quantum Many-Body Physics
that will take place in Toulouse, France (4th-8th April 2022).
The school will take place in hybrid format (with both online and onsite students and lecturers).</description></item><item><title>NetKet 3 ❤️ Jax</title><link>/posts/01-welcome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/01-welcome/</guid><description>18 months in development, NetKet 3.0 indicates a major new step for the NetKet project. NetKet has been totally rewritten in Python and is now a Jax-based library. This guarantees outstanding performance while allowing researchers to exploit machine-learning frameworks to define advanced Neural-Networks.
GPUs and Google’s TPUs are now supported too!
Update now and try the new examples!</description></item></channel></rss>
